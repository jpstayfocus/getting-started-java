### Java
- Object Oriented Programming language
- Created by James Gosling in 1995
- 3 Billion devices run Java programs
- Similar to C++ but easier (dont have to allocate memory)
- Very Popular

### What can you build with Java?
- Mobile apps for Android (nowadays poeple use Kotlin and Switch for IOS)
- Desktop App using Java swing, JavaFx
- Enterprise applications
- Games such as [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)
- Cloud based applications
- Web applications
- and much more

### Java Usages

### Compliled vs Interpreted Languages
- Java is compiled/interpreted language
- Backend
- JavaScript is an interpreted
- Mostly used on web browsers and some backend with NodeJS

Compiler is special progam that processes statement written in a particular programming language and turns them into a machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses

Interpreter reads each statement of code and then converts or executes it directly.
